# Assignment 10 Spatial data

The exercises for this week is based on the data available from [http://wfs-kbhkort.kk.dk](http://wfs-kbhkort.kk.dk).

## Exercise 1
Copenhagen has a strategy for improving the living conditions in socially exposed areas (udsatte områder). It a policy which both addresses the social aspects for the people living there, and the physical conditions.

This exercises addresses the physical conditions, through the following two questions:

* How many parks are located in exposed areas?
* How many trees are located in exposed areas?

The Copenhagen data is in Danish, so here is a brief word/search list:

* exposed areas (udsatte byomraader)
* trees along roads (gadetræer/gadetraer)
* parks (parkregister)

### Handin
* SQL dump of the databases used (after you loaded them into MySQL)
* The queries used to answer the two questions
* The result of the query

### Review
Free text comment regarding the handin - good as well as possible improvements

## Exercise 2
Copenhagen prides itself for its lively bike culture. There are a number of different data on bike and bike services. But in particular, bikes do not mix well with trucks. 

* How many bike racks are places along routes for heavy traffic?

Again, to help navigate the danish table names:
* bike rack (cykelstativ)
* heavy traffic (tungvogn)

### Handin
